### Hi there üêô

I am a postdoctoral scholar at the BioFrontiers Institute at CU Boulder. My current work is supported by The Kavli Foundation and will develop an analytical approach to infer functional connectivity from neurophysiological data. You can nerd-snipe me by network science, neuroscience, computational topology, and convex optimization!
